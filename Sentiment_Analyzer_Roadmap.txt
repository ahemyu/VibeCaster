Step 1: Data Collection

Objective: Gather a dataset of product reviews along with their associated sentiments.

Technologies/Algorithms:

    Pre-labeled datasets from platforms like Kaggle
    Web scraping using libraries like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy

Outcome:

    A dataset saved in a file format like CSV, containing product reviews and their corresponding sentiment labels (positive, neutral, negative).

Step 2: Data Exploration

Objective: Understand the basic characteristics and distribution of the data.

Technologies/Algorithms:

    Pandas for data manipulation
    Matplotlib or Seaborn for data visualization

Outcome:

    Summary statistics of the data
    Visualizations showing the distribution of sentiments, and possibly other interesting insights.

Step 3: Data Preprocessing

Objective: Prepare the text data for machine learning.

Technologies/Algorithms:

    Tokenization, stemming, and removal of stopwords using Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) or spaCy
    Feature extraction techniques like TF-IDF or Bag-of-Words

Outcome:

    A processed dataset ready for training, ideally in a numerical format that can be fed into machine learning algorithms.

Step 4: Model Training

Objective: Train a machine learning model to predict the sentiment of a review.

Technologies/Algorithms:

    Machine Learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or even more complex models like Random Forests or SVM.
    Libraries like scikit-learn for model training

Outcome:

    A trained machine learning model saved to disk, ready for evaluation and deployment.

Step 5: Model Evaluation

Objective: Assess the performance of the trained model.

Technologies/Algorithms:

    Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
    Use scikit-learn's built-in functions for this

Outcome:

    Detailed evaluation metrics for the model to understand how well it's performing.

Step 6: User Interface

Objective: Build a user interface for easier interaction with the model.

Technologies/Algorithms:

    CLI using Python's argparse or a web interface using Flask/Django
    HTML/CSS for web UI

Outcome:

    A working interface where a user can input a product review and receive a sentiment analysis.

Step 7: Documentation

Objective: Create comprehensive documentation and possibly unit tests.

Technologies/Algorithms:

    Markdown for README
    Python's unittest framework for unit tests

Outcome:

    A well-documented GitHub repository, complete with README, code comments, and possibly unit tests.
